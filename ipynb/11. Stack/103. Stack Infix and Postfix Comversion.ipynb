    "\n",
    "$$8+3\\times \\frac{(9-6)}{2^2}+\\frac{6}{2}$$\n",

    "AS : Addition and Subtraction (start from left to right)\n",

    "1. First do brackets : $(9-6)$\n",
    "2. Then do power : $2^2$\n",
    "3. Then Division $(9-6)/2^2$\n",
    "4. Other division: $6/2$\n",
    "5. Then multiplication: $3\\times(9-6)/2^2$\n",
    "6. Then additions: +, + (left to right)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So from the above what are we doing. We have to go into the expression, and see which one to perform, and jumping around from left to right. This is very inefficient way of doing things. We scanning the expression random times, based on precedence, going back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a way to start scanning the expression from left to right, reading it sequentially, and execute the expression? Thats is get the answer by doing only one scan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes we can use postfix form.\n",

    "$$8\\;3\\;9\\;6 - 2^2\\;/\\;\\times +\\; 6\\;2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure:\n",
    "1. First Use bodmas rule, to get the above expression\n",
    "2. Read until you get the first operator, which is minus.\n",
    "3. What do we do with the minus:  we perform this operation on the previous two(2) operands\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 9-6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then move forward, look for next: $2^2$, then next operator is division.\n",
    "5. What do we do with the division:  we perform this operation on the previous two(2) operands\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{9-6}{2^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above we can see the how we write postfix, we apply Bodma's Rule. But then do only one scan.Lets continue\n",

    "The above seem to be written incorrectly, here is the correct version:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$8\\;3\\;9\\;6 - \\times \\;2^2\\;/\\;\\times +\\; 6\\;2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the purpose of postfix is to write expression, and with one scan get an answer. (fast)\n",
