    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With linear probing we will be using the following Mod Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h'(x) = (h(x) + f(i))\\%{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{where } f(i) = i$$\n",
    "$$ \\text{and } i=0,1,2,...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note we can still apply our default mod hashing function, until we get a collision.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also here we do not use LL, we insert directly into the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take the following keys, apply the hashing function, and see how they wil be inserted.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We insert until we get a collision. That will be when we need to insert 25, and 45 has already that place.\n",
