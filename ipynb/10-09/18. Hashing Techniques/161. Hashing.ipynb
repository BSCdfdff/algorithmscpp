    "___\n",
    "Hashing is useful for searching. But we have already know searching techniques which falls into the following category:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Search, with time taken $O(n)$\n",
    "2. Binary Search, with time taken $O(log_2{n})$ (But keys must be sorted)\n",
    "\n",
    "With binary search taking faster to find the item, than linear search. But can we improve this time. The other only improvement, is any value less $O(log_2{n})$, so that will be Constant Time. That is $O(1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea of hashing in introduced. So the reason behind hashing is for faster searching. So how do we implement this?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement it similar to index based sorting we did previously. That is we store keys in itds index position. So when we need to find a key, we dont need to perform a search for it. We simply just go to the index position and see if it is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The only drawback, is that it takes a huge consumption of space.\n",
