    "One of the primary requirements of Hashing Function is that the values in hash table should be uniformed distributed, and should not be concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And the selection of hash function depends on the programmer.\n",
    " \n",
    "With Chaining the hash table size can be anything\n",
    "\n",
    "With Linear probing the hash table size should be double the number of elements.So I am going to insert 10 elements, so the size of the has table must be 20. So the loading factor must be less than or equal to .5. So we give extra space for achieving hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the Mod function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h1(x) = x\\%{size}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we do not want values to start at 0, we can add 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h1(x) = x\\%{size} + 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But what should be the size of tabl. We said it should be double the elements. But we should make it prime number so the collisions will be reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "So sueggestion is to make the size (mod), equal to prime number. so if we have hashtable of size 9, it best to take size rather as 11 or 13.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$12+33+47=92$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can store the number in index 92. And if that is too big, we can perform mor add 9+2 to give 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember when searching we need to perform the same procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the above are numeric keys. What if we have string and keys. Key =\"ABC\". How do we convert this into index in array.\n",
