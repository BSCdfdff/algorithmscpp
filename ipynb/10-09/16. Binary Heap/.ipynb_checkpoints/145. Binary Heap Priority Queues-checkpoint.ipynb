    "Elements are inserted along with their priority. We can determine that elements with largest value has the highest priority. And when we delete, we delete element with the highest priority.\n",

    "2. And the above takes : $O(1)$. Constant time, we simple compying the element.\n",

    "4. So we will search for element and shifting elements (we cant have blank spaces):, which n for searching and n for shifting.\n",
    "5. Delete will take $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But insertion takes constant time, deletion takes order of n times. Is there a way for deletion also to take constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can create a HEAP or the keys in the array. And how much time does it take to insert? \n",
