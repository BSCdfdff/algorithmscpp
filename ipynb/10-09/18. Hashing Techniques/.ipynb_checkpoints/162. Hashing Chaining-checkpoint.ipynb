    "\n",
    "First one is dividing the elements size, and that is called the loading factor:\n",

    "Remember when we looked at the time complexity previously, we only looked at number of elements, n.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here we also need to look at the size of the hashing table, and that needs to worked into our time complexity calculation as well, That why we have loading factor now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So analysis of hashing is always based on these two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numbber of elements (n)\n",
    "2. Size of hashing table\n",
    "\n",
